## 💬 About the C Language

**C** is a powerful and general-purpose **procedural programming language** developed by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Labs** in 1972.  
It serves as the foundation for many modern programming languages such as **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.

C is widely used for:
- System programming (Operating systems, Compilers)
- Embedded systems
- Algorithm and Data Structure implementation
- Performance-critical applications

C provides **low-level memory access**, **pointer manipulation**, and **structured programming**, making it ideal for learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** efficiently.

## 🧩 What are Data Structures?

**Data Structures** are ways of organizing and storing data efficiently for easy access and modification.  
They define how data is arranged in memory and how operations like **insertion**, **deletion**, **searching**, and **traversal** are performed.

### 🔹 Common Types of Data Structures:
- **Linear Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
- **Non-linear Data Structures:** Trees, Graphs  
- **Hash-based Data Structures:** Hash Tables  

Understanding data structures is essential for writing efficient code and solving complex computational problems.
