## 💬 Brief Introduction of this Repository  

"**Data-Structure-Practicals**" Repository has been created as part of learning and teaching materials for Computer Science and Engineering students.  
This repo covers **10 major practical programs** of the **C Language**, focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts.  

Each practical explores important topics such as **Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Stacks**, **Queues**, **Trees**, **Graphs**, **Sorting**, and **File Handling** — forming the backbone of computer programming.  

You can go through all these programs to learn **how to approach problem-solving**, **how to implement logic**, and **how different data structures interact in memory**.  
Each practical demonstrates a key programming concept with clean and simple C implementations.

## 💬 About the C Language  

**C** is a powerful and general-purpose **procedural programming language** developed by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Labs** in 1972.  
It forms the foundation for many modern programming languages like **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.

### 🔹 C is widely used for:
- System programming (Operating Systems, Compilers)
- Embedded systems
- Algorithm and Data Structure implementation
- Performance-critical applications  

C offers **low-level memory access**, **pointer manipulation**, and **structured programming**, making it perfect for learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** efficiently.

## 🧩 What are Data Structures?  

**Data Structures** are specialized ways of organizing and storing data efficiently so that they can be accessed and modified effectively.  
They define how data is arranged in memory and how operations like **insertion**, **deletion**, **searching**, and **traversal** are performed.  

### 🔹 Common Types of Data Structures:
- **Linear Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
- **Non-linear Data Structures:** Trees, Graphs  
- **Hash-based Data Structures:** Hash Tables  

Mastering these structures helps in developing efficient algorithms and optimizing real-world applications.
